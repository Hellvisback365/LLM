Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles. Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user's tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. IMPORTANT: Make specific reference to movies the user has enjoyed to discover related but different genres. Each user should receive personalized recommendations based on their unique profile. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movie IDs.

    "justification": "The final recommendation list was compiled by prioritizing movies that appeared in the precision@k lists across the different user IDs, especially those ranked higher. This ensures that the top recommendations are highly likely to be relevant to the user's explicit preferences. To incorporate coverage and introduce diversity, movies from the coverage lists were included, particularly those that also appeared in at least one precision@k list or represented genres present in the user's liked movies but less prominent in the initial precision-focused selections. The ordering reflects a balance, with movies consistently ranked high in precision@k appearing first, followed by a mix of high-precision and high-coverage items. Duplicates were removed to ensure a unique list of 50.",
    "trade_offs": "The primary trade-off was between maximizing precision@k for the very top recommendations and ensuring adequate coverage across genres and potentially less obvious but still relevant movies. While the initial focus was on high-precision items, a conscious effort was made to weave in movies from the coverage lists to broaden the scope of recommendations. This might slightly reduce the absolute precision of the entire list compared to a purely precision-driven approach, but it enhances the likelihood of the user discovering new, enjoyable films outside of their immediate viewing history."
