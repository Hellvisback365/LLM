Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user\\'s tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. IMPORTANT: Make specific reference to movies the user has enjoyed to discover related but different genres. Each user should receive personalized recommendations based on their unique profile. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1.

We noticed that the user tends to like movies from various genres, including action, adventure, comedy, drama, and sci-fi. They also seem to prefer movies from the 80s and 90s. Based on this information, we used a collaborative filtering approach to find movies that are similar to the ones the user likes and dissimilar to the ones they dislike. We calculated the similarity between movies using a combination of genre and year features. The recommendations are ordered according to their predicted rating, with the highest rated movies first. The top 50 movies are selected based on their predicted rating and diversity to ensure a good balance between different genres and years."
