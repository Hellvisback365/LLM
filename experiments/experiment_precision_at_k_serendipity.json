Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles. Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user's tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. IMPORTANT: Make specific reference to movies the user has enjoyed to discover related but different genres. Each user should receive personalized recommendations based on their unique profile. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movie IDs.

The list of 50 recommendations MUST be ordered as described above (compromise between diversity and relevance first, pure diversity last).\\n3.

The initial selections heavily favor movies that appeared frequently and with high rankings in the precision-focused lists (e.g., 1240, 2571, 3793, 1200). To ensure adequate coverage and introduce some diversity, movies that appeared in the coverage lists but not in the initial precision-focused selections were added, particularly those that still align with the user's stated genre preferences (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller). The ordering reflects this balance, with high-precision items at the top and coverage-focused items filling the remaining slots, while still attempting to maintain a cohesive feel based on the user's overall profile. Duplicates were removed to ensure a unique list of 50.",
    "trade_offs": "The primary trade-off was between maximizing precision at the very top of the list and ensuring a broader coverage of genres and potentially less-seen but relevant movies. By prioritizing precision initially and then incorporating coverage items, the list aims to provide highly relevant recommendations upfront while still exposing the user to a wider range of potentially interesting films. This means some highly-ranked coverage items might appear lower than some precision items, and vice versa, to achieve the target of exactly 50 recommendations with a reasonable balance."
