Given the extensive list of liked and disliked movies by the user, a content-based filtering approach was initially considered. However, to introduce serendipity and avoid over-specialization, movies from various genres and years were selected. The list includes a mix of action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, and thriller movies from different decades, ensuring a diverse range of recommendations. Movies like 'Time Tracers' (1995), 'Men in Black' (1997), 'Gattaca' (1997), and 'The Matrix' (1999) are included for their blend of action and sci-fi, appealing to fans of futuristic and thrilling content. Comedies such as 'Groundhog Day' (1993) and 'Toys' (1992) are recommended for their light-hearted and entertaining value. Dramas and thrillers like 'Patch Adams' (1998) and 'Total Recall' (1990) add depth and variety. The selection also considers the user's apparent interest in older films, with inclusions like 'Logan's Run' (1976) and 'The Deer Hunter' (1978), balancing nostalgia with more contemporary releases. This approach aims to provide the user with a list that not only reflects their interests but also encourages exploration of new genres and eras, enhancing the discovery experience."
