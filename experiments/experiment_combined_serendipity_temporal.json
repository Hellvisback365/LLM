    "justification": "The final recommendation list of 50 movies was compiled by prioritizing the top recommendations from the precision@k lists across the different user profiles (4277, 4169, and 1680). The rationale is that these movies are most likely to align with the user's explicit preferences based on their liked movies. The lists were merged, and duplicates were removed. The initial ordering heavily favors the movies that appeared in the top ranks of multiple precision@k lists. To ensure adequate coverage and introduce some diversity, movies from the coverage lists were included to reach the total of 50, prioritizing those that also appeared in the lower ranks of the precision@k lists or represented genres that were less prominent in the initial high-precision selection but still align with the user's broader interests (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller, and some Adventure, Crime, and War). The final list is ordered with the highest precision items first, followed by a blend of precision and coverage items, aiming for a cohesive set that balances direct relevance with the potential for discovery.",
    "trade_offs": "The primary trade-off made was balancing high precision with sufficient coverage. While the top of the list is heavily weighted towards movies with high precision scores across multiple models, ensuring that the most likely relevant movies are presented first, this could potentially limit the exposure to a wider variety of genres or older films. To mitigate this, movies from the coverage lists were incorporated to reach the target of 50 recommendations. This introduces a broader range of movies, including those from different eras and potentially less represented genres within the user's core preferences, at the cost of potentially including some movies that are less precisely aligned with the user's historical likes compared to the very top recommendations. The ordering reflects this trade-off, with precision taking precedence in the initial ranks and coverage playing a larger role in the later ranks to complete the list of 50. Another trade-off was in handling discrepancies between the precision@k lists from different models; in cases where a movie was highly ranked by one model but not another, its position in the final list was determined by considering its rank across all models and its genre alignment with the user's overall profile. The goal was to create a list that feels both highly relevant and offers some degree of exploration within the user's general taste profile, rather than being strictly limited to the most obvious choices from a single metric or model."
