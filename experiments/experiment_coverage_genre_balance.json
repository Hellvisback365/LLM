    "justification": "The final recommendation list prioritizes precision@k, especially for the top recommendations, by heavily weighting the movies that appeared in the precision@k lists across the different user profiles. Movies that appeared in multiple precision@k lists were given higher priority. The ordering within the precision@k lists was also considered, with higher-ranked movies receiving more weight. To ensure adequate coverage, particularly in the latter half of the list, movies from the coverage lists that did not appear in the precision@k lists were included. These were selected to introduce genre diversity and temporal spread, balancing the strong genre focus of the precision@k lists. The final list of 50 movies is a blend of highly relevant movies based on past likes (from precision@k) and movies that expand the user's potential interests (from coverage), with a clear emphasis on relevance in the initial recommendations.",
    "trade_offs": "The primary trade-off was balancing precision and coverage. Prioritizing precision for the top recommendations means that some potentially interesting but less directly relevant movies from the coverage lists were ranked lower or excluded. Conversely, including movies from the coverage lists that were not in the precision@k lists means that some highly precise recommendations might have been slightly lower in the final ranking than they were in their original precision@k lists. The goal was to create a list that is highly likely to be enjoyed (precision) while still offering opportunities for discovery (coverage), with a bias towards precision at the top."
