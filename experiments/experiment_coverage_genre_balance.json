When analyzing the catalog, pay particular attention to:\\n- Genre matching with positively rated movies.\\n- Thematic and stylistic similarity to favorite movies.\\n- Avoid movies similar to those the user did not appreciate.\\n\\nDO NOT recommend movies based on general popularity or trends, unless these characteristics align with this specific user\\'s unique preferences. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend a list containing EXACTLY 50 movie IDs. No more, no less than 50.\\n2.

We noticed that the user tends to like movies from various genres, including action, adventure, comedy, drama, and sci-fi. They also seem to prefer movies from the 80s and 90s. Based on this information, we used a collaborative filtering approach to find movies that are similar to the ones the user likes and dissimilar to the ones they dislike. We calculated the similarity between movies using a combination of genre and year features.
