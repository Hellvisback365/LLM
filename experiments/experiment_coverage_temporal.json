When analyzing the catalog, pay particular attention to:\\n- Genre matching with positively rated movies.\\n- Thematic and stylistic similarity to favorite movies.\\n- Avoid movies similar to those the user did not appreciate.\\n\\nDO NOT recommend movies based on general popularity or trends, unless these characteristics align with this specific user\\'s unique preferences. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend a list containing EXACTLY 50 movie IDs. No more, no less than 50.\\n2.
