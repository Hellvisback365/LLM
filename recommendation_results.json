The approach is to first identify the user's preferred genres and then select movies that belong to those genres. If a movie belongs to multiple genres, it will be recommended only once. The remaining movies will be selected from the catalog to fill the list of 50 recommendations. The list is ordered to prioritize movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. The user's liked movies are used to discover related but different genres."

I prioritized precision@k for top recommendations, as it directly reflects the user's preferences. For coverage, I aimed to maximize genre diversity while maintaining relevance to the user's tastes. The final list of 50 movie IDs is a balance between the two, with the most relevant movies first and the most diverse movies last. I selected movies that match the user's highly rated genres, themes, and attributes, and excluded movies similar to those the user did not appreciate. Trade-offs considered include the potential for precision@k to suffer when prioritizing coverage, and the risk of missing highly relevant movies in favor of more diverse options.",
