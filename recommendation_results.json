It then gradually introduces more diverse genres like documentary, adventure, and thriller, while keeping some alignment with the user's taste for drama and romance.

These movies are followed by those that maximize genre diversity while maintaining relevance, such as 'The English Patient' (1203) and 'The Green Mile' (1441). Towards the end, the list includes movies that prioritize pure diversity, like 'Night of the Living Dead' (968) and 'Identification of a Woman' (1360), to expand the user's movie horizon. The ordering ensures that the most relevant and diverse movies are recommended first, gradually introducing more diverse options.",

Movies that are highly relevant to the user's preferences were prioritized at the beginning of the list to ensure user satisfaction. However, to introduce the user to new genres and expand their movie horizon, diversity was gradually increased towards the end of the list. This approach balances the need for relevant recommendations with the benefit of exploring new genres, providing a well-rounded movie-watching experience."
