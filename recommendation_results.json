The recommendations start with movies that balance genre diversity and user relevance, such as '2001: A Space Odyssey' (924) and 'Delicatessen' (1175), which match the user's interest in sci-fi and offbeat comedies. As the list progresses, it includes more movies that prioritize pure diversity, introducing the user to different genres like drama, romance, and horror, while still considering their preferences. For example, 'The Shawshank Redemption' (318) is not in the list as it was not provided in the catalog, but other highly rated dramas are included. The list is ordered to ensure that the most relevant and diverse recommendations are presented first, followed by movies that expand the user's genre exposure. This approach aims to reduce the risk of filter bubbles and enhance the user's movie-watching experience."
