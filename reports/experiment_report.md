#### Valutazione Finale Aggregata
- **Raccomandazioni Finali**: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Jurassic Park (1993), Three Musketeers, The (1993), Delicatessen (1991), Aliens (1986), Terminator, The (1984), Deer Hunter, The (1978), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Batman Returns (1992), Hunt for Red October, The (1990), Gattaca (1997), Time Tracers (1995), Big Lebowski, The (1998), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), Family Plot (1976), Merry War, A (1997), Say Anything...

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendations are based on a balance between precision@k and coverage metrics. The top recommendations from the precision@k metric are prioritized, as they are more likely to be of interest to the user. The coverage metric is used to ensure that the recommendations cover a diverse range of genres and time periods. The ordering of the recommendations is based on the similarity between the user's liked movies and the movies in the catalog, with the most similar movies appearing first. The justification for the specific ordering is that the system prioritizes movies that are most likely to be of interest to the user, based on their past preferences.
- **Trade-offs**: The trade-off between precision@k and coverage metrics is considered, with a greater weight given to precision@k for the top recommendations. This is because the top recommendations are more likely to be of interest to the user, and the system wants to maximize the likelihood of the user enjoying the suggested films. However, the coverage metric is also important, as it ensures that the recommendations cover a diverse range of genres and time periods, and are not limited to a specific type of movie. The system balances these two metrics to provide a personalized set of recommendations that cater to the user's diverse tastes.

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendations are based on a balance between precision@k and coverage metrics. The precision@k metric is given more weight for the top recommendations, ensuring that the most relevant movies are prioritized. The coverage metric is used to ensure a diverse range of movie genres and decades are included in the recommendations. The ordering of the movies is based on their relevance to the user's profile, with the most relevant movies first. The recommendations include a mix of classic and modern films, as well as a range of genres such as action, comedy, drama, and sci-fi.
- **Trade-offs**: The trade-off between precision@k and coverage metrics is considered, with a focus on prioritizing precision@k for the top recommendations. This means that some movies with high coverage scores may not be included in the final recommendations if they do not have a high precision@k score. Additionally, the recommendations may not include all possible genres or decades, but rather a diverse range that is relevant to the user's profile. The use of multiple metrics and the consideration of trade-offs ensures that the final recommendations are personalized and relevant to the user.

Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles. Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user\\'s tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. IMPORTANT: Make specific reference to movies the user has enjoyed to discover related but different genres. Each user should receive personalized recommendations based on their unique profile. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movie IDs.

The list of 50 recommendations MUST be ordered as described above (compromise between diversity and relevance first, pure diversity last).\\n3.
