#### Valutazione Finale Aggregata

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendation list of 50 movies was compiled by prioritizing the top recommendations from the precision@k lists across the different user profiles (4277, 4169, and 1680). The rationale is that these movies are most likely to align with the user's explicit preferences based on their liked movies. The lists were merged, and duplicates were removed. The initial ordering heavily favors the movies that appeared in the top ranks of multiple precision@k lists. To ensure adequate coverage and introduce some diversity, movies from the coverage lists were included to reach the total of 50, prioritizing those that also appeared in the lower ranks of the precision@k lists or represented genres that were less prominent in the initial high-precision selection but still align with the user's broader interests (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller, and some Adventure, Crime, and War). The final list is ordered with the highest precision items first, followed by a blend of precision and coverage items, aiming for a cohesive set that balances direct relevance with the potential for discovery.
- **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off made was balancing high precision with sufficient coverage. While the top of the list is heavily weighted towards movies with high precision scores across multiple models, ensuring that the most likely relevant movies are presented first, this could potentially limit the exposure to a wider variety of genres or older films. To mitigate this, movies from the coverage lists were incorporated to reach the target of 50 recommendations. This introduces a broader range of movies, including those from different eras and potentially less represented genres within the user's core preferences, at the cost of potentially including some movies that are less precisely aligned with the user's historical likes compared to the very top recommendations. The ordering reflects this trade-off, with precision taking precedence in the initial ranks and coverage playing a larger role in the later ranks to complete the list of 50. Another trade-off was in handling discrepancies between the precision@k lists from different models; in cases where a movie was highly ranked by one model but not another, its position in the final list was determined by considering its rank across all models and its genre alignment with the user's overall profile. The goal was to create a list that feels both highly relevant and offers some degree of exploration within the user's general taste profile, rather than being strictly limited to the most obvious choices from a single metric or model.

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendation list prioritizes precision@k, especially for the top recommendations, by heavily weighting the movies that appeared in the precision@k lists across the different user profiles. Movies that appeared in multiple precision@k lists were given higher priority. The ordering within the precision@k lists was also considered, with higher-ranked movies receiving more weight. To ensure adequate coverage, particularly in the latter half of the list, movies from the coverage lists that did not appear in the precision@k lists were included. These were selected to introduce genre diversity and temporal spread, balancing the strong genre focus of the precision@k lists. The final list of 50 movies is a blend of highly relevant movies based on past likes (from precision@k) and movies that expand the user's potential interests (from coverage), with a clear emphasis on relevance in the initial recommendations.
- **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off was balancing precision and coverage. Prioritizing precision for the top recommendations means that some potentially interesting but less directly relevant movies from the coverage lists were ranked lower or excluded. Conversely, including movies from the coverage lists that were not in the precision@k lists means that some highly precise recommendations might have been slightly lower in the final ranking than they were in their original precision@k lists. The goal was to create a list that is highly likely to be enjoyed (precision) while still offering opportunities for discovery (coverage), with a bias towards precision at the top.

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendation list of 50 movies was compiled by prioritizing the recommendations from the precision@k metric across the different user profiles. The top recommendations from each precision@k list were given the highest weight, ensuring that movies most likely to align with the user's explicit preferences (Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, and Thriller) are at the top of the final list.  To incorporate coverage and introduce serendipity, movies that appeared in the coverage lists but also had some presence in the precision@k lists (even if lower ranked) were included to broaden the temporal and genre diversity.  Specifically, movies like 3947, 3763, 3764, 3706, 3830, and 3908 were included as they appeared in multiple lists, balancing precision with exposure to different cinematic periods and potentially less-watched but relevant films. The ordering reflects a balance, with the absolute top precision@k recommendations leading the list, followed by a mix of high-precision and good-coverage items. The goal was to create a cohesive list that feels personalized while still offering some discovery.
- **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off was balancing the strong signal from precision@k, which focuses on movies similar to those the user has liked, with the need for coverage, which aims to expose the user to a wider variety of films. Prioritizing precision@k for the top recommendations means that the initial part of the list is highly likely to contain movies the user will enjoy based on past behavior. However, this could lead to a less diverse list overall. By incorporating movies that appeared in the coverage lists, even if they were lower in the precision@k rankings, we aimed to mitigate this by introducing different genres and temporal periods. This might slightly reduce the immediate "hit rate" compared to a purely precision-focused list, but it increases the chance of the user discovering new favorites outside their usual patterns. The final ordering reflects this trade-off, with a strong emphasis on precision at the very top and a more balanced approach further down the list.

#### Valutazione Finale Aggregata
- **Raccomandazioni Finali**: X-Men (2000), Matrix, The (1999), Terminator, The (1984), Aliens (1986), Hunt for Red October, The (1990), Abyss, The (1989), Running Man, The (1987), Strange Days (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), Predator (1987), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), Bird on a Wire (1990), Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), F/X (1986), F/X 2 (1992), Reindeer Games (2000), Patriot Games (1992), End of Days (1999), World Is Not Enough, The (1999), Anaconda (1997), Deep Impact (1998), Soldier (1998), Godzilla 2000 (Gojira ni-sen mireniamu) (1999), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), eXistenZ (1999), Independence Day (ID4) (1996), Chain Reaction (1996), Twister (1996), Perfect Storm, The (2000), Guns of Navarone, The (1961), Bridge at Remagen, The (1969), Last of the Mohicans, The (1992), Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977), Shaft (1971), Fatal Beauty (1987), Bait (2000), Condition Red (1995), Angel Heart (1987), Hollow Man (2000), Puppet Master (1989), Puppet Master II (1990), Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991), Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Puppet Master (1998), Retro Puppetmaster (1999), Firestarter (1984)
- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendation list was compiled by prioritizing movies that appeared in the precision@k lists across the different user IDs, especially those ranked higher. This ensures that the top recommendations are highly likely to be relevant to the user's explicit preferences. To incorporate coverage and introduce diversity, movies from the coverage lists were included, particularly those that also appeared in at least one precision@k list or represented genres present in the user's liked movies but less prominent in the initial precision-focused selections. The ordering reflects a balance, with movies consistently ranked high in precision@k appearing first, followed by a mix of high-precision and high-coverage items. Duplicates were removed to ensure a unique list of 50.
- **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off was between maximizing precision@k for the very top recommendations and ensuring adequate coverage across genres and potentially less obvious but still relevant movies. While the initial focus was on high-precision items, a conscious effort was made to weave in movies from the coverage lists to broaden the scope of recommendations. This might slightly reduce the absolute precision of the entire list compared to a purely precision-driven approach, but it enhances the likelihood of the user discovering new, enjoyable films outside of their immediate viewing history.

- **Giustificazione**: The final recommendation list was generated by prioritizing the top recommendations from the precision@k metric across the different recommenders. The initial selections heavily favor movies that appeared frequently and with high rankings in the precision-focused lists (e.g., 1240, 2571, 3793, 1200). To ensure adequate coverage and introduce some diversity, movies that appeared in the coverage lists but not in the initial precision-focused selections were added, particularly those that still align with the user's stated genre preferences (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller). The ordering reflects this balance, with high-precision items at the top and coverage-focused items filling the remaining slots, while still attempting to maintain a cohesive feel based on the user's overall profile. Duplicates were removed to ensure a unique list of 50.
- **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off was between maximizing precision at the very top of the list and ensuring a broader coverage of genres and potentially less-seen but relevant movies. By prioritizing precision initially and then incorporating coverage items, the list aims to provide highly relevant recommendations upfront while still exposing the user to a wider range of potentially interesting films. This means some highly-ranked coverage items might appear lower than some precision items, and vice versa, to achieve the target of exactly 50 recommendations with a reasonable balance.
