The precision@k metric is given more weight for top recommendations, ensuring that the most relevant movies are prioritized. The coverage metric is also considered to ensure a diverse range of movie genres and release years. The recommendations are ordered based on their ranking in the precision@k metric, with the most relevant movies appearing first. The justification for this approach is that it provides a personalized set of recommendations that cater to the user's interests while also introducing them to new movies they may not have considered before.</td></tr><tr><th>Trade-offs</th><td>The trade-off between precision@k and coverage metrics is a key consideration in the final recommendations. Giving more weight to precision@k ensures that the most relevant movies are recommended, but may result in a less diverse range of genres and release years. On the other hand, prioritizing coverage may lead to a more diverse set of recommendations, but may also include less relevant movies. The final approach balances these trade-offs by prioritizing precision@k for top recommendations while still considering coverage to ensure a diverse range of movies.</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate (Per Utente)</h4><h5>Utente 4277</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0000</td><td>0.7778</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.1500, P@50=0.1200</td><td>0.9444</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 4169</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.1000, P@20=0.0500, P@50=0.0400</td><td>0.8889</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0200</td><td>0.7778</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 1680</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.1000, P@20=0.0500, P@50=0.1000</td><td>0.8889</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0000</td><td>1.0000</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate</h4><div class='metrics-container'><div class='metric-block'><h5>Precision/MAP @k (e.g., @10)</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore @10</th></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.0667</td></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (coverage)</td><td>0.0000</td></tr></table></div><div class='metric-block'><h5>Mean Genre Coverage</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore</th></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.8519</td></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (coverage)</td><td>0.9074</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='experiment'><h3>coverage_genre_balance</h3><p>Data: 2025-05-20T19:59:34.608516</p><h4>Varianti Prompt</h4><pre>{

The precision@k metric is given more weight for the top recommendations to ensure that the most relevant movies are suggested first. The coverage metric is used to ensure that a diverse range of movie genres and release years are included in the recommendations. The ordering of the movies within each metric's list is taken into account, with higher ranked items being more important. The final list of 50 movie recommendations is a balanced mix of movies from different genres and release years, with a focus on the most relevant and diverse titles.</td></tr><tr><th>Trade-offs</th><td>The main trade-off considered is between the precision@k and coverage metrics. Giving more weight to precision@k ensures that the most relevant movies are recommended first, but may result in a less diverse range of genres and release years. On the other hand, giving more weight to coverage may result in a more diverse range of movies, but may include less relevant titles. The final recommendations aim to balance these two metrics to provide a personalized and diverse set of movie recommendations.</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate (Per Utente)</h4><h5>Utente 4277</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.1000, P@50=0.1000</td><td>0.9444</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.1000, P@20=0.1000, P@50=0.0600</td><td>0.9444</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 4169</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.1000, P@20=0.1500, P@50=0.1200</td><td>0.9444</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0500, P@50=0.0600</td><td>0.9444</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 1680</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.2000, P@20=0.1000, P@50=0.0600</td><td>0.8889</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0600</td><td>0.8889</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate</h4><div class='metrics-container'><div class='metric-block'><h5>Precision/MAP @k (e.g., @10)</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore @10</th></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.1000</td></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (coverage)</td><td>0.0333</td></tr></table></div><div class='metric-block'><h5>Mean Genre Coverage</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore</th></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.9259</td></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (coverage)</td><td>0.9259</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='experiment'><h3>precision_at_k_recency</h3><p>Data: 2025-05-20T19:58:55.326296</p><h4>Varianti Prompt</h4><pre>{

Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles. Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user\\'s tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance.

Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles. Make sure your recommendations cover different genres, but are aligned with the user\\'s tastes. Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance. IMPORTANT: Make specific reference to movies the user has enjoyed to discover related but different genres. Each user should receive personalized recommendations based on their unique profile. \\n<output_requirements>\\n1. From the # Movie catalog provided by the user in their message, you MUST select and recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movie IDs.
