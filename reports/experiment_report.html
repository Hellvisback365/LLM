The top recommendations from the precision@k metric are prioritized, as they are more likely to be of interest to the user. The coverage metric is used to ensure that the recommendations cover a diverse range of genres and time periods. The ordering of the recommendations is based on the similarity between the user's liked movies and the movies in the catalog, with the most similar movies appearing first. The justification for the specific ordering is that the system prioritizes movies that are most likely to be of interest to the user, based on their past preferences.</td></tr><tr><th>Trade-offs</th><td>The trade-off between precision@k and coverage metrics is considered, with a greater weight given to precision@k for the top recommendations. This is because the top recommendations are more likely to be of interest to the user, and the system wants to maximize the likelihood of the user enjoying the suggested films. However, the coverage metric is also important, as it ensures that the recommendations cover a diverse range of genres and time periods, and are not limited to a specific type of movie. The system balances these two metrics to provide a personalized set of recommendations that cater to the user's diverse tastes.</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate (Per Utente)</h4><h5>Utente 4277</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0400</td><td>0.8333</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0000</td><td>0.9444, GenreEntropy=3.4586</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 4169</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0000</td><td>0.9444</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.1000, P@50=0.0400</td><td>0.8333, GenreEntropy=3.5779</td></tr></table><h5>Utente 1680</h5><table><tr><th>Strategia di Prompt</th><th>Precision@k Scores</th><th>Genre Coverage</th></tr><tr><td>precision_at_k</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.2000, P@10=0.2000, P@20=0.1000, P@50=0.0800</td><td>0.8889</td></tr><tr><td>coverage</td><td>P@1=0.0000, P@5=0.0000, P@10=0.0000, P@20=0.0000, P@50=0.0000</td><td>1.0000, GenreEntropy=3.6286</td></tr></table><h4>Metriche Calcolate</h4><div class='metrics-container'><div class='metric-block'><h5>Precision/MAP @k (e.g., @10)</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore @10</th></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.0667</td></tr><tr><td>MAP@10 (coverage)</td><td>0.0000</td></tr></table></div><div class='metric-block'><h5>Mean Genre Coverage</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore</th></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (precision_at_k)</td><td>0.8889</td></tr><tr><td>GenreCov (coverage)</td><td>0.9259</td></tr></table></div><div class='metric-block'><h5>Total Item Coverage</h5><table><tr><th>Metrica</th><th>Valore</th></tr><tr><td>Item Coverage (System)</td><td>0.0680</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='experiment'><h3>coverage_temporal</h3><p>Data: 2025-05-26T12:38:06.555005</p><h4>Varianti Prompt</h4><pre>{

Given a list of movies in the # Movie catalog from the user message, recommend an ORDERED list of EXACTLY 50 movies that maximize coverage of different film genres, BUT that are still relevant to the specific preferences of the user whose profile you are analyzing. Coverage measures the proportion of the entire catalog that the system is able to recommend. The goal is to better explore the available movie space and reduce the risk of filter bubbles.

Order the list by putting first the movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, and last those that prioritize pure diversity more at the expense of immediate relevance.
