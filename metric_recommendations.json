      "explanation": "The recommendations are based on maximizing genre coverage while remaining relevant to the user's preferences. The user's liked movies suggest a preference for sci-fi, action, and comedy genres. The recommendations start with movies that represent a good compromise between genre diversity and user preferences, such as '2001: A Space Odyssey' (sci-fi) and 'Die Hard' (action). The list then includes movies that prioritize pure diversity, introducing the user to new genres like drama, romance, and horror. The ordering ensures that the most relevant movies are presented first, followed by those that expand the user's genre exposure. The explanation for the specific ordering is as follows: the first 20 movies are chosen based on their relevance to the user's liked movies, with a focus on sci-fi and action genres. The next 15 movies introduce drama and romance genres, which are less represented in the user's liked movies but still relevant. The final 15 movies prioritize pure diversity, introducing horror, comedy, and other genres to expand the user's preferences. The recommendations are ordered to balance relevance and diversity, ensuring that the user is exposed to new genres while still enjoying movies that align with their preferences."
