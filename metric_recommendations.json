The list is ordered to prioritize a balance of genre diversity and your likely interests first, gradually introducing more diverse options towards the end. This approach aims to introduce you to new genres like Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Horror, Children's, Animation, Musical, Documentary, Crime, Romance, Mystery, and War, while keeping in mind the dramatic and thrilling elements you seem to appreciate. For example, since you liked \"Disclosure\" (225) which is a Drama/Thriller, I included other Thrillers and Dramas, but also branched out to Action/Thrillers like \"The Net\" (185) and Sci-Fi/Thrillers like \"Species\" (196). Your enjoyment of \"Prizzi's Honor\" (3685), a Comedy/Drama/Romance, led me to include other Comedy, Drama, and Romance films, and then explore combinations like Action/Comedy/Drama (\"Get Shorty\" - 21) and Comedy/Romance (\"Trouble in Paradise\" - 3739) to broaden the scope. The selection includes a mix of well-known titles and some less common ones to ensure good coverage of the available catalog."
