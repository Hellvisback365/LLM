The list starts with movies that balance genre diversity and user preferences, such as 'Night of the Living Dead' (Horror|Sci-Fi) and 'Identification of a Woman' (Drama). It then gradually introduces more diverse genres like documentary, adventure, and thriller, while keeping some alignment with the user's taste for drama and romance. Movies like 'The Bicycle Thief' (Drama) and 'The Official Story' (Drama) are included to maintain relevance, while films like 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' (Comedy) and 'Nekromantik' (Comedy|Horror) add genre diversity. The list ends with movies that prioritize pure diversity, such as 'The Way of the Gun' (Crime|Thriller) and 'Almost Famous' (Comedy|Drama), which might be less immediately relevant but expand the user's movie horizon significantly."
